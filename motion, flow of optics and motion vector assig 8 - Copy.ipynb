    "### Motion Vectors in Video Compression\n",
    "A motion vector is a mathematical representation of the displacement of a block of pixels in a video frame relative to its position in a reference frame. These vectors are crucial in predicting how parts of one video frame move to the next, leveraging temporal redundancy between consecutive frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of Motion Vectors in Reducing Redundancy\n",
    "1.Predictive Coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Motion vectors are used in inter-frame prediction, where the current frame is predicted based on a reference frame (previous or future).\n",
    "Instead of storing the entire frame, only the motion vectors and residuals (differences) are encoded, significantly reducing data size.\n",
    "Efficient Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "By identifying repetitive or predictable movements (e.g., a moving car), motion vectors allow the encoder to avoid redundant storage of unchanged or predictably changing pixel regions.\n",
    "Block Matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frames are divided into blocks, and motion vectors describe the shift of these blocks between frames. For instance, if a block in Frame A matches a shifted block in Frame B, the motion vector records that shift.\n",
    "Reduced Bandwidth and Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "By encoding motion vectors and residuals, video compression standards like MPEG, H.264, and H.265 achieve smaller file sizes and lower transmission bandwidth while preserving visual quality.\n"
